## Overview
Put a review on a movie and express how much you liked it or sometimes disliked it! ðŸŒŸ
The Web application is made using React JS on the front end, Spring Boot in the back end and MongoDB as the database.
You can put reviews on your favorite or not-so-favorite movie by tapping on it and writing your review about it. The review will be saved in the MongoDB database and will be featured on the screen for others to see.
